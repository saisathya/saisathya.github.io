# Welcome!

I'm Sathya.

I'm a software engineer based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

I spent the last few years of my life obtaining my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at [San Jos√© State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_State_University).

In this site, I plan on [documenting](/blog) new things I've learnt, primarily in the field of computer science. The inspiration behind the name of this site comes from [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/944652.Poor_Charlie_s_Almanack).

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-sathyanantha-rajandiran/) or by [e-mail](mailto: saisathyanantharajandiran@gmail.com).
